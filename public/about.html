<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m an aspiring web developer who loves bringing ideas to life on the web.
   I enjoy building clean, modern websites that don’t just look good but actually 
   work smoothly for the people using them. Right now, I’m focused on sharpening 
   my skills in front-end and back-end development, and I’m always experimenting 
   with new tools and frameworks to expand my toolkit.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I’m usually brainstorming project ideas, learning 
  something new about tech, or exploring creative ways to solve problems. My 
  goal is to grow into a developer who can design digital experiences that 
  feel simple, engaging, and enjoyable.</p>
